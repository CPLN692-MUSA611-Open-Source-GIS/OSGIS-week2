    # Lab 1, Part 5 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project Euler.
    Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science problems
    that can be solved using any language (for our class, use Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you
    will be able to submit your final result.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    Successfully completing a project Euler problem will be noted as extra effort
    when considering your participation grade. These are not - at all - easy problems
    so don't kill yourself.

    Start code

    ===================== */

    // question 1
    var sum = 0

    for (var i=1; i<1000; i++){
        if(i%3 == 0){
            sum += i;
        }else if(i%5 == 0){
            sum += i;
        }
    }
    console.log(sum) //233168

    // question 2
    var sumFib = 2
    var fib = [1, 2]

    while (true) {
        next = fib[fib.length-1] + fib[fib.length-2]
        fib.push(next)
        if (next >= 4000000){
            break;
        }
        else if (next%2==0) {
            sumFib = sumFib + next;
        }
    }
    console.log(sumFib)
