    # Lab 1, Part 5 â€” Stretch Goal: Project Euler

    ## Introduction

    Practice your Javascript and math skills by solving a problem on Project Euler.
    Project Euler is a series of challenging math and computer science problems
    that can be solved using any language (for our class, use Javascript).

    Solve the first problem on this page https://projecteuler.net/archives
    (Multiples of 3 and 5). To check your answer, create an account and you
    will be able to submit your final result.

    Problem 1: Multiples of 3 and 5

    If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, 
    we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. 
    The sum of these multiples is 23.
    Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

    If you complete problem 1, move on to problem 2!

    Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers

    Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. 
    By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

    1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

    By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, 
    find the sum of the even-valued terms.

    Successfully completing a project Euler problem will be noted as extra effort
    when considering your participation grade. These are not - at all - easy problems
    so don't kill yourself.

        p1Answer += i;
      }
    }
    console.log(p1Answer)

    // Problem 2
